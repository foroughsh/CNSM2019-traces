# CNSM2019-traces
Here are traces which we used to obtain our results for our paper:
F. S. Samani, H. Zhang, and R. Stadler, \Ecient learning on high-dimensional operational data," in 2019 15th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM), pp. 1{9, IEEE, 2019.

Traces are colloected from KTH labratory. To collect the traces we run two Video on Demand (VoD) and Key-value (KV) services. You can find more details about these traces in the following pappers:
